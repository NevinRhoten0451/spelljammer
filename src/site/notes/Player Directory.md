## Player Directory
Welcome adventurer's to the space faring world of Spelljammer. This directory will  serve as both a guide to what exactly Spelljammer is and an overview of the one-shot adventure I will be running in it. Be you seekers of fortune, novice explorers, or ruthless wildspacers, wildspace offers vast oceans of adventure.

Perhaps if this call to adventure out there in the endless sea of stars is too much to resist, it need not be constrained to a single one-shot, but that is a question for the future.

> [!question] Note: Disclaimer
> While most of the words you'll read in this directory are mine, not all are, especially for the areas further down detailing locations and species. Those sections were copied directly out of DnD sourcebooks.

### Spelljammer Publication History
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:***</mark>

- "Spelljammer is a campaign setting originally published for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (2nd edition) role-playing game, which features a fantastic (as opposed to scientific) outer space environment. Subsequent editions have included Spelljammer content; a Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition setting update was released on August 16, 2022."

---

- "Spelljammer introduced into the AD&D universe a comprehensive system of fantasy astrophysics, including the Ptolemaic concept of crystal celestial spheres. Crystal spheres may contain multiple worlds and are navigable using ships equipped with 'spelljamming helms'. Ships powered by spelljamming helms are capable of flying into not only the sky but into space. With their own fields of gravity and atmosphere, the ships have open decks and tend not to resemble the spaceships of science fiction, but instead look more like galleons, animals, birds, fish or even more wildly fantastic shapes."

- "The Spelljammer setting is designed to allow the usual sword and sorcery adventures of Dungeons & Dragons to take place within the framework of outer space tropes. Flying ships travel through the vast expanses of interplanetary space, visiting moons and planets and other stellar objects."

- "Like the Planescape setting, Spelljammer unifies most of the other AD&D settings and provides a canonical method for allowing characters from one setting (such as Dragonlance) to travel to another (such as the Forgotten Realms). However, unlike Planescape, it keeps all of the action on the Prime Material Plane and uses the crystal spheres, and the 'phlogiston' between them, to form natural barriers between otherwise incompatible settings. Though the cosmology is derived largely from the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, many of the ideas owe much to the works of Jules Verne and his contemporaries, and to related games and fiction with a steampunk or planetary romance flavor. A strong Age of Sail flavor is also present."

- "Shannon Appelcline, in the book Designers & Dragons (2011), highlighted that in 1989 Spelljammer was the first of a host of new campaign settings published by TSR. It was created by Jeff Grubb and 'introduced a universe of magical starships traversing the 'crystal spheres' that contained all the earthbound AD&D campaign worlds. It suggested a method to connect together all of TSR's settings and at the same time introduced fun new Jules Verne-esque technology that had never before been seen in the game. It was innovative and popular'. Appelcline commented that Spelljammer 'offered a way to connect every single D&D fantasy world, was thus one of the first true crossovers' in role-playing games."

### Terminology
Below you will find definitions of crucial aspects and fantasy concepts common throughout all of Spelljammer, including what the hell a Spelljammer actually is. While these are helpful, for quick reference during actual play, you can use the Astral Adventurer's Guide.

Know that if you have no interest in the finer aspects of this setting, that's okay. You can feel free to skim this section and learn things organically during play, but if you seek greater immersion in this world, I would recommend you familiarize yourself with the broad strokes of it's design and lore. At the end of the day Spelljammer is about magic ships sailing through magic space using magic, and that's the gist of it. 
#### Great Wheel Cosmology
The **Great Wheel Cosmology** is the most popular cosmological model of the planes within the worlds of Dungeons and Dragons. It is a representation of the relationship the planes have to one another, not necessarily a depiction of their actual physical relation in space. There are three main elements of the Great Wheel most important to understanding the structure of the planes, the **Prime Material Plane**, the **Inner Planes**, and the **Outer Planes**. The Prime Material Plane is where adventures in Spelljammer mostly take place.
##### Prime Material Plane
The **Prime Material Plane** seems at the center of everything, but that could not be further from the truth. In the Great Wheel Cosmology, the Prime Material Plane, or simply the **'Prime'**, is where the elements of matter from the Inner Planes form to create infinite worlds of life. The Prime Material Plane is a plane like any other, formed of numerous **Crystal Spheres**. Imagine these Crystal Spheres like galaxies each containing their own world, and these worlds float within an infinite expanse called the **Astral Plane**, or the **'Astral Sea'**. While the worlds contained within Crystal Spheres vary drastically, they are all considered part of the Prime. What is **Wildspace** then? That is simple. Wildspace is the airless void between astronomical bodies within a Crystal Sphere. With this understood we can separate the Prime Material Plane into these two elements.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Crystal Spheres:***</mark> Crystal Spheres, sometimes called **'Crystal Shells'**, are gigantic spherical shells that contain an entire planetary system, or 'world'. They float within the Astral Plane, which is described in further detail below. 
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Wildspace:***</mark> The space between astronomical bodies within a Crystal Sphere. This neighborhood of celestial and planetary bodies is called a **Wildspace System**. To reach the Astral Plane from Wildspace one must first travel to the edge of whatever Crystal Sphere they are in till they reach its border where the two overlap. 

> [!question] Note: Realmspace
> Realmspace is the Crystal Sphere that this adventure takes place in. It is home to the planet Toril, the primary setting of the Forgotten Realms.
###### Astral Plane
The Astral Plane is, quite literally, the plane of stars. More precisely, it is where the stars and portals to the Outer Planes reside—an infinitely vast celestial void that surrounds all the worlds of the Prime Material Plane.

In Wildspace, the Material Plane and the Astral Plane overlap. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and are effectively on both of those planes at once. If you were to leave your home world and continue outward until you neared the edge of your Wildspace system, you would begin to see a faint, silvery haze. By traveling into this haze, you pass from Wildspace into the Astral Sea, more colorfully known as the **'Silver Void'**. The deeper into the Astral Sea you travel, the thicker and brighter the haze becomes, but the stars that shine through it are always visible.

The Astral Sea, like Wildspace, is a void; however, it is not an airless one. Here, you can breathe normally and exist indefinitely, never aging and never needing food or drink. You can propel yourself through the Astral Sea with the power of your mind alone, though many astral voyagers wisely travel in well-armed ships, for this place is the home of a host of fearsome creatures. Here travelers might find the petrified hulks of dead gods and swirling pools of color that serve as portals to other planes of existence. 

To relate this to our world, imagine that the **Milky Way** is our *Crystal Sphere*. The space between **Earth** and other stellar bodies within the Milky Way is our *Wildspace*. The edge of the Milky Way meets our *Astral Plane*, and the nearest other Crystal Sphere would be **Andromeda**.

---
***<p style="text-align:center;">"You want to know of the Prime, visit it. The boundless worlds of that plane have an infinite variety, as do the planes, but I cannot encapsulate them as I have here. Suffice it to say they are the birth of the Outer Planes, the children of the Inner, and they hold limitless potential within their boundaries." — The spirit Asonje.</p>***![Astral Plane.jpg](/img/user/Z_Art/Astral%20Plane.jpg)**<p style="text-align:center;">Visions of the Astral Plane</p>**

---
##### Inner Planes
The **Inner Planes** are the planes of matter, It is from these planes that the *Material* of the Prime Material Plane is derived. To a greater extent they are the source of the **Fundamental Building Blocks** of **Matter** and **Energy** for the entire multiverse. The Inner Planes contain environments that are among the most hostile in the multiverse. Unlike the Outer Planes, which are built on belief and thought, the Inner Planes are the manifestation of central aspects of **Physical Reality**. As a result of this intense concentration of reality, everything in the Inner Planes, including its inhabitants, feels more vivid and intense, while at the same time more indifferent. The term **'Inner'** refers to the placement of the planes at the center of the concentric spheres that make up the Great Wheel model. It is also an allusion to the planes' central role in providing the raw stuff that nurture the multiverse's existence. They can all be reached from the Prime Material Plane by traveling through the misty **Ethereal Plane**. 

There are four main Elemental Planes that I'm sure will sound familiar, **Air**, **Fire**, **Earth**, and **Water**. While this may seem simple, there are many more aspects to the Inner Planes, such as the **Positive** and **Negative Energy Planes** and the **Para** and **Quasi Elemental Planes**, but they are not crucial in understanding the Inner Planes importance and function in the broader cosmology.

##### Outer Planes
The Outer Planes are potentially the most fascinating part of the planar cosmology that encompasses the many worlds of Dungeons and Dragons. They are planes of **Thought**, **Concept**, and **Belief**. They are ever shifting yet forever stagnant. They are birthed by mortals, afterlives of our own creation and definition where gods dwell and scheme. Know however, that the terrible dangers and divine pleasures of the Outer Planes are very much a reality. Beyond the scope of most people's understanding, the Outer Planes are the subject of planar philosophers and arcane scholars, but their existence effects all. Imagine a circle, as depicted in the Great Wheel. Now imagine a vertical and horizontal line which intersects at it's center. The top of the circle is **Good**, the bottom, **Evil**. The right end of the circle is **Chaos**, and the left, **Law**. The circle is an axis used to show the relationship each plane has with these four core aspects of alignment, the center being **True Neutrality**. For example, **Elysium** is the plane of ultimate *Good*, while **Hades** is the plane of ultimate *Evil*. **Mechanus** is the plane of ultimate *Law*, while **Limbo** is the plane of ultimate *Chaos*. These four planes rest at one of the four end points of the lines we drew through the circle, the planes in between them representing different degrees of alignment, such as **Mount Celestia** which represents *Lawful Good*, and the **Nine Hells** which represents *Lawful Evil*. 

The **Astral Plane** discussed above connects the first layer of each Outer Plane to the Prime Material Plane and vice versa. The simple fact is that if I were to describe every Outer Plane and all of the intersections between them, I would be writing a short book, but this cursory glimpse is enough to understand their function in the cosmology.

#### Spelljamming
**Spelljamming** is the act of using a **Spelljamming Helm** to pilot a **Spelljammer** anywhere within the many worlds of the Prime Material Plane and the Astral Sea. We have already discussed what those planes are, so now we can define the different aspects of Spelljamming. Once again, if you crave a deeper understanding of these elements, consult the Astral Adventurer's Guide.
##### Spelljammers
**Spelljammers** are ships that are magically sailed and maneuvered through space by Spelljamming Helms. They come is a variety of shapes and sizes and no two ships are the same. Remember that Spelljammers don't look like typical space ships from science fiction, instead looking like pirate ships mixed with both fantastical and steampunk elements straight out of a Jules Verne novel. 


> [!question] Note: Ship Repairs
> Nonmagical repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 20 hit points of damage to a berthed ship takes 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.
> 
> The Mending spell is a cheaper, less time-consuming way to make repairs. Casting mending on a damaged ship restores a number of hit points to the target equal to 1d8 plus the spellcaster’s spellcasting ability modifier. The target can regain hit points from that spell no more than once per hour.

---

A Spelljammer is made up of three core parts, the **Ship Itself**, the **Spelljamming Helm**, and the **Arcane Drive**. We have already discussed the ship, so let's define what the last two pieces are.

##### Spelljamming Helms
The function of **Spelljamming Helms**, which typically resemble a classical sailing ships helm carved with intricate glyphs, patterns, and sigils, is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. The Helm is the heart of the ship, without it there would be no space travel, and thus, no Spelljammer. The base of a Spelljamming Helm is usually surrounded by an intricate panel of arcane knobs, levers, dials, and other nodes that assist in piloting the ship. Pipe work that steams with magical energy weaves its way through every part of the ship, all stemming from the helm. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.

If you are proficient in Space Vehicles you can use the Spelljamming Helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship’s speed. If the ship is in space and no other hostile spelljamming vessels are close by, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours. You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.

Creating a Spelljamming Helm takes arcane knowledge far beyond the capabilities of most, and requires rare and unique components, often times varying form Helm to Helm. **Mercanes**, celestial creatures who dwell in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, are the foremost creators and merchants of Spelljamming Helms. Luckily, they are a species who believe in fair commerce and don't ever charge more for something than it is worth. On the flip side, the docile **Dohwar**, penguin like people imbued with telepathy, are the foremost builders of regular spelljamming ships, arcane drives, and weavers. If your ship needs repairs, find some Dohwar, but know their prices are constantly shifting.

Many monstrous denizens of wildspace and beyond have secret methods of building spelljammer ships, helms, and arcane drives. Most of these are not compatible with 'regular' spelljammers. 


> [!question] Note: Spelljamming Helms and You!
> Since it is likely one of you will want to take on the role of Captain, you will be in charge of piloting your spelljammer. You might be asking yourself then, *do I have to stay at the helm the entire game*? NO. In this situation we must simply acknowledge that such a task would not be very fun. A dedicated friendly Pilot (or Helmsman) NPC will take control of the helm while the captain joins in encounters. As discussed further on, the captain retains full control over the ship while this friendly NPC pilots it. The friendly NPC in question will be none other than Flapjack the Flumph!

Fore the voyage is long and the winds don't blow and it's time for us to leave her!" — Flapjack</p>***![Flapjack the Flumph.jpeg](/img/user/Z_Art/Flapjack%20the%20Flumph.jpeg)**<p style="text-align:center;">Flapjack Is Fond of Using His Telepathy to Sing Sea Shanties In People's Heads</p>**

---
##### Arcane Drives
The **Arcane Drive** is a crucial component in spelljammers that channels the magical energy of the Spelljamming Helm through ship, allowing it to be piloted through space. Typically built into the Spelljamming Helm itself, Arcane Drives are as unique as the myriad ships they can be found in, but typically resemble spheres or other simple shapes engraved with magic glyphs that swell and pulse with magical energy. 

---
***<p style="text-align:center;">"A trusty Arcane Drive is as important as a trusty pilot. Treat it right and it will take your ship to the farthest reaches of wildspace. Overcharge the thing and it might just kill you." — Captain Elaina Sartell</p>***![Arcane Drive.jpg](/img/user/Z_Art/Arcane%20Drive.jpg)**<p style="text-align:center;">Simple Arcane Drives</p>**

---

Arcane Drives come in various rarities, the better Arcane Drives infused with more **Arcane Drive Charges**. These will be discussed further on in the section detailing Spelljammer Combat, but know that overcharging a ships Arcane Drive can have dire consequences. Arcane Drives also power smaller spacefaring vehicles that aren't equipped with Spelljamming Helms, most notably the **Weaver**. Creating Arcane Drives is decidedly simpler that creating a Spelljamming Helm, but still not an easy task. Their creation has been mastered by most ship builders across the realms, such as the Dohwar.

### The Crew
Every spelljammer has a crew, and that crew keeps the ship moving. In this adventure, it would be apt for every party member to have some special role they play on the ship, including the role of **Captain**, which is the only role that has gameplay ramifications. Note that there will be many NPC crew members who can join in on this spacefaring adventure as well. Below are some titles a crew member might have. 
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Captain:***</mark>  The captain, ship's captain, captain, master, or shipmaster, is a spacefarer who holds ultimate command and responsibility of a spelljamming vessel. In combat, when it comes around to your ships turn, you have ultimate authority on where it moves and what actions it takes, sometimes requiring the coordination of other crew members.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***First Mate:***</mark> The first mate is the second in command and is responsible for cargo operations, assisting in navigation, and overseeing the deck alongside the captain.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Spelljammer Helmsman:***</mark> The helmsman pilots the spelljamming helm which propels the ship through space while the captain is otherwise occupied. They must be an NPC. They obey the navigational commands of the captain always.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Quartermaster:***</mark> The quartermaster manages the supplies and cargo on board a spelljammer. They are responsible for maintaining living quarters, food rations, clothing, and other supplies. 
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Chief Arcanist :***</mark> The chief arcanist is comparable to a real ships chief engineer. They are responsible for maintaining and repairing the many arcane components aboard a vessel, such as the helm and arcane drive, as well as the connections between them that power the ship. Only spellcasters can act as a ships chief arcanist. 
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Cook :***</mark> No mysteries here, the cook prepares food for all aboard a spelljamming vessel. Perhaps if you wish to claim this title we can discuss allowing you a free version of the Chef Feat.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Master-At-Arms:***</mark> The master-at-arms is responsible for maintain all on board weaponry. Regarding the many magical weapons a spelljammer can be outfit with, they often work closely with the chief arcanist.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Deckhand:***</mark> Deckhands operate the many parts of a spelljamming ship both during navigation and battle. They are the generalists of a ship, often serving as lookouts and rigsman.

#### Air Envelopes
When a creature or an object leaves a planet’s atmosphere and enters Wildspace, an *envelope of breathable air forms around it and lasts until that air is depleted*. The envelope of breathable air that forms around a creature takes the shape of a sphere centered on that creature. 

A creature that needs to breathe will exhaust the air in its personal envelope in **1 Minute**. Since this is barely enough time to get anywhere, most creatures travel through Wildspace aboard spelljamming ships, which have much larger air envelopes. Weavers and other personal mounts also provide air envelopes, typically **10 Minutes** of breathable air.

The air envelope around a spelljamming ship typically has an ovoid shape. The diagram below shows the air envelope that surrounds a nautiloid that has a keel length of 180 feet. It extends 180 feet from the ship in all directions.

The air envelope around a habitable planet or moon is called an atmosphere. An atmosphere is a special kind of air envelope that replenishes itself constantly. A creature or an object can refresh its air envelope by entering the atmosphere of a planet or moon.

> [!question] Note: Fire In Wildspace
> Although nonmagical fire cannot exist in the vacuum of Wildspace, magical fire (such as that created by a fireball spell) does burn in a vacuum. Magical fire does not cause objects to burst into flame, however, because there is no air to make ignition possible.



#### Air Quality
The air envelope around a body or ship can be **Fresh**, **Foul**, or **Deadly**. Air can change from one quality to another over time.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Fresh Air:***</mark> Fresh air is completely breathable. Under normal circumstances, the air envelope of a ship remains fresh for **120 Days**. If a ship carries more creatures than its normal crew complement, they exhaust the supply of fresh air more quickly.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Foul Air:***</mark> Foul air is stale and partially depleted. It is humid and smells bad. Any creature that breathes foul air becomes **Poisoned** until it breathes fresh air again. The air aboard a ship with a normal crew complement degrades from fresh to foul on day 121, and the foul air turns deadly **120 Days** later.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Deadly Air:***</mark> Deadly air is unbreathable. Any creature that tries to breathe deadly air begins to **Suffocate**.

##### Overlapping Air Envelopes
When two bodies come close enough to each other, their air envelopes **Merge**, and the quality of the air around the smaller body changes to match that of the larger body. When the bodies later move away from each other, each one reclaims and retains its own air envelope.

For example, if a damselfly ship with a foul air envelope enters the atmosphere of a planet with fresh air, the two air envelopes merge, and the damselfly ship’s air quality changes from foul to fresh. If that ship then merges its fresh air envelope with the deadly air envelope surrounding a derelict ship, the damselfly ship’s air quality would change from fresh to deadly.

#### Gravity Planes
The reason everything pulls its own atmosphere along through space is the force of **Gravity**. It’s also the reason why creatures can stand on a spacefaring ship without falling off the deck.

In Wildspace and on the Astral Plane, gravity is an accommodating force, in that the direction of its effect seems to be **“that which is most convenient"**. For an object the size of a planet or moon, gravity pulls everything toward the center of the body, meaning that creatures can stand upright anywhere on the surface, and dropped objects fall perpendicular to the surface they land on.

For smaller objects, such as spacecraft, gravity doesn’t radiate from a point but rather from a **Plane** that cuts horizontally through the object and extends out as far as its air envelope. An object’s gravity plane is two-directional: a creature can stand upright on the bottom of a ship’s hull—upside down from the perspective of those elsewhere on the ship—and move around as easily as if it were walking on the top deck. The diagram below shows the location of the gravity plane of a nautiloid, by way of example, and indicates the directions in which its gravity operates.

One of the unusual properties of a gravity plane is that an object that falls off the side of a ship can end up oscillating back and forth across the gravity plane. It drops in one direction until it crosses the plane, then reverses direction back toward the plane again, continuing until something causes it to stop.

### Spelljammer Combat
The biggest piece of advice I can offer you regarding combat aboard your spelljammer is *do not feel anchored to the ship*. **Weavers** and other modes of transportation allow you to take the fight *off the deck and into the stars*, you can bet your enemies will be doing much the same to try and board your vessel. On the topic of boarding, that is typically the goal of both parties in a spelljammer engagement. Below is a list of relevant info for ship to ship combat.

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Stats:***</mark> Each ship has it's own **Stats** which determine it's capabilities in combat. Imagine ships like their own creatures on the battle map, as opposed to strictly a mount.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Ship Class:***</mark> There are three types of Ship class. 
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">**Skiffs**</mark> are small and mobile ships. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">**Frigates**</mark> are medium sized ships with average mobility. 
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**Juggernauts**</mark> are large and durable ships with lower speed.
-  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Attunement Slots:***</mark>  Some magical items are designed to be equipped by spelljamming vessels. Each class of ship has a different number of attunement slots. It takes **8 Hours** to attune a ship mounted magic item.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">**Skiffs:**</mark>  2 Slots.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">**Frigates:**</mark> 3 Slots.
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**Juggernauts:**</mark> 4 Slots.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Initiative:***</mark> Spelljammers do not role initiative, instead *sharing the initiative of their Captain*, and acting *before or after* the captains turn in the initiative order. If the captain should be incapacitated or killed, they decide above table who takes control of the vessel.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Saving Throws:***</mark> Should a ship be forced to make a **Saving Throw**, it uses the stats of it's current captain, or primary pilot in the case of solo mounts such as weavers. Should a ship have no active captain, it's current **Spelljamming Pilot** makes the saves. Should it be lacking both, it automatically fails. Should a captain be incapacitated, they still make the saves for the ship.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Stations:***</mark> Spelljammers have various **Stations**, most common being on board weapons. Stations can be used with **Actions** that a creature can take *if it is currently on the vehicle or mount that provides it*. Each station can only be used once per round, unless stated otherwise.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Mishaps:***</mark> Whenever a vessel takes enough damage, it might trigger a **Mishap**. These can also be triggered by Overcharging a ships arcane drive. 

#### Sample Ship Statblock
Let's go over a ships statblock to get a better understanding of it's features. I'll also be showing you the **Weaver** stats and discussing it a bit more. Don't worry, this is the last thing before we read about character creation. Below are the stats for one of the most common and iconic spelljamming vessels, the **Space Galleon**. This Space Galleon is equipped with an **Uncommon Arcane Drive**, giving it **2 Arcane Drive Charges**. Note that some of the stats here are **Redundant**, such as the ships main stat scores, which change to be it's current captains. The tool I'm using to generate the stat block doesn't allow me to remove some core aspects of DnD monster stat blocks. 

I will also be giving some of the ships three ratings, **Defense**, **Offense**, and **Mobility**. Each ship will get different **Star** ⭐ **Ratings** based on their capabilities, rated out of 4.

Also, keep in mind that most of this has been created by **Me**, for this game, using some community homebrew as influence. It is probably not balanced at all, and that is okay, because I think it will be fun. Trust that I have your fun in mind ( :

Lets go over every aspect of this stat block in order of appearance. As can be found in the Space Galleon's dedicated note, these are it's **Star Ratings**. The Space Galleon has a 2 in each stat, making it the ultimate all-rounder ship.

> [!INFO] Space Galleon Star Ratings
> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">**DEFENSE**</mark> : ⭐⭐:luc_star: :luc_star: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**OFFENSE**</mark> ⭐⭐:luc_star: :luc_star: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">**MOBILITY**</mark> ⭐⭐:luc_star: :luc_star:


- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Size:***</mark> Almost all spelljammer ships are large enough to be considered **Gargantuan** creatures. The Space Galleon is a **Frigate** class ship, meaning is has **3 Attunement Slots**.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Armor Class:***</mark> **15** is standard AC for a frigate class ship.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Hit Points:***</mark> Hit points are self explanatory, and 350 is standard for a frigate class ship. 
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">***Damage Threshold:***</mark> The Space Galleon has a **Damage Threshold** of **15**, standard for frigate class ships. This means that any attack that deals 15 damage or less to the ship *deals no damage*.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">***Mishap Threshold:***</mark> The Space Galleon has a **Mishap Threshold** of **50**, standard for frigate class ships. This means that any single attack that deals 50 damage or more to the ship *causes a mishap*.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Speed:***</mark> When near another hostile spelljamming vessel, the Space Galleon hovers through space at **35 ft. Per Round**. It can move up to this distance on it's turn and is directed by its captain, but controlled by its spelljamming pilot. Remember that when spelljammers are not near another hostile ship, their speed is greatly increased.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Stats:***</mark> Ships share their core stats with their active captain, as discussed previously.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Damage Immunities:***</mark> Since spelljammer are inanimate objects moved by magic, all of them tend to have immunities to both **Poison** and **Psychic** damage. They take no damage from these types.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Condition Immunities:***</mark> Since spelljammer are inanimate objects moved by magic, all of them tend to have immunities to many conditions.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Redundant:***</mark> Ignore the ships **Passive Perception** and **Languages** sections. Ships possess neither.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Traits:***</mark> Typically a ships traits include three main things, but potentially more.
	- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">***Arcane Drive:***</mark> The rarity of a ships **Arcane Drive** determines how many **Arcane Drive Charges** it can use **Per Long Rest** of the party. This Space Galleon has an **Uncommon Arcane Drive**, giving it 2 charges. On a ships turn, the captain decides when or if to use an Arcane Drive Charge to fuel one of the ships features. This can take the form of **Actions**, **Bonus Actions**, or **Reactions**. In the case of Reactions, the captain decides if a charge is used to fuel a feature when the trigger is met. Only **One** Arcane Drive ability can be used per round.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">***Overcharge:***</mark> All ships equipped with an Arcane Drive can use **Overcharge**. I have a **D100** which I will use when rolling Overcharge Checks. A roll of **50 Or Higher** causes a mishap regarding the **First** use of Overcharge.  A roll of **90 Or Higher** causes a mishap regarding the **Second** use of Overcharge.
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**Stations:**</mark> Stations are on-board weaponry and equipment. Any creature on the ship can use a station provided they position themselves near it. Some **Magic Items** act like stations when attuned to the ship.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Actions:***</mark> Typically every ship has a powerful unique action available to it with the **Recharge Feature**. After being used, this action only becomes available again if the ship rolls a **5 Or 6** on a **D6** at the start of its turn. In the case of this Space Galleon, this is its **Cannon Salvo**. Other actions typically require the use of an Arcane Drive Charge.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Bonus Actions:***</mark> While the Space Galleon does not have any bonus actions, some ships do, typically requiring the use of an Arcane Drive Charge.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">***Reactions:***</mark> As discussed before, In the case of Reactions, the captain decides if a charge is used to fuel a feature when the trigger is met.

##### Weavers
As discussed before, **Weavers** are incredibly common mounts in Wildspace, built primarily by the Dohwar species who are also the foremost creators of Arcane Drives. Weavers often resemble pointed crafts with tall seats and a thruster positioned on the rear. People customize and aesthetically modify their weavers even more so than spelljamming ships, no weaver identical to another.  They are powered solely by Arcane Drives and do not have the ability to channel the Arcane Drives magic into features like Spelljammers. They are used almost exclusively to take the fight off a spelljammers deck and into wildspace. Everyone in the party has access to their own personal weaver. 

For the sake of simplicity, imagine a weaver like a mount, but one whose sole purpose is to increase your speed and allow you to fly through space. Weavers typically do not have weapons and do not have any ability to take actions themselves. They can be targeted by attacks however, and can be destroyed. As discussed before, weavers and other personal mounts also provide air envelopes, typically **10 Minutes** of breathable air before needing to refresh it.

#### Weaver Statblock
As you can see, the Weaver statblock is decidedly more simple than a spelljammers, and that is because their function is much simpler as well. Regarding the **Proficiency** in **Space Vehicles**, that is something each of your characters will gain for free in this adventure, so don't fret over it. 

Just like ships, their saving throws are made using the stats of the current pilot and they can be repaired in the same way. Your weaver can be as simple as you'd like, or you can give some thought to it's design, maybe even give it a name. Don't be afraid to look up **'Hover Bike'** and find one that looks cool to you, but try to find something that doesn't look overtly sci-fi.

> [!question] Note: Weaver Storage
> While it depends on the vessel, most weavers are stored in a ships cargo deck. A special hatch  opens to allow weavers to fly out into space. Any good crew knows how to send out their weavers right and quick.

### Character Creation
And here we are! This is the last bit I promise. If you have made it this far, thank you. Since this is a one-shot adventure, you should focus on making fun and unique characters who are interested in adventuring out in the reaches of space and beyond. Remember, however, that there is potential for this game to be more than a one-shot, so avoid making characters who are overly goofy (joke characters) or characters you don't think you would be interested in for more than a few sessions. 

#### Thematic Touchstones
The world of spelljammer is one of pulpy science fiction melded with classic fantasy troupes and ideas flipped on their heads to fit into a strange and alien setting. Don't be afraid to make a character based on one of your favorites from other pieces of science fiction. Think of the stern captain, the loyal mercenary, the aloof bounty hunter, the alien ally, the wise elder, or even the fish out of water (a character unfamiliar with the world of spelljammer who stumbles into it by chance and must adapt). All of these and more could make for great character inspiration
##### Media
There are a number of different creative media that I think of when imagining the world of Spelljammer. I'll list them below. Perhaps they can be springs of inspiration for you as they have for me.

#### Adventure and Character Themes
Spelljammer is a setting that supports a unique kind of pulpy high stakes adventure that is perfect for characters who are just as unique as the setting itself. Don't be afraid to make characters who are a bit more **'Out There'** than typical. Embrace those pulpy and campy elements of both fantasy and sci-fi, but don't forget to make a character who is still grounded in the world with tangible motivation and backstory. Below you will find three guidelines that also act as questions to fuel you characters development.
- ##### What Motivates You?
	What compels your character to explore and adventure in dangerous wildspace? Is it fame, fortune, legacy, destiny,  or dynasty? Is it a lost loved one, the challenge, a missing family heirloom, or any number of other things?
- ##### What Are Your Strengths?
	Think about what makes your character unique as a wildspacer. What special strengths do they have that define them and make them stand out from the rest?
- ##### What Are Your Flaws?
	No one like to think about their flaws, but it is meaningful flaws that round out a character and make them more relatable and real. I challenge you to think of a character you love without any meaning flaws. I recommend thinking of 2 flaws that impact your character. This may seem odd, but I tend to use the *Seven Deadly Sins* as inspirations for my characters flaws. Are they prideful, vain, envious, or greedy? You get the idea.

> [!question] Note: Backstory
> I'm not going to force any of you to write backstories for what might only be a one-shot adventure, but remember this has the potential to be expanded upon. With that in mind, I would highly recommend you write at least a paragraph of backstory for your character using these guidelines as help and inspiration. 

#### Where Are You From?
Wildspace is a big place, or places I suppose, so I understand it might be overwhelming to think of how your character fits into it. I wouldn't recommend thinking to hard about this. Come up with a simple background for your story and we can work together to fit them into the game world. 

With that in mind however, this adventure does begin in a location your characters should be familiar with, the **Rock of Bral**.

---
***<p style="text-align:center;">"There's no place quite like the Rock." — Captain Elaina Sartell</p>***![The Rock of Bral.jpg](/img/user/Z_Art/The%20Rock%20of%20Bral.jpg)**<p style="text-align:center;">The Rock Drifts Through Wildspace</p>**

---
##### History of the Rock of Bral
The Rock traces its roots back to roughly 170 years ago, when the eponymous Captain Bral established a pirate refuge here. The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral’s death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership of the city.

Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock—that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock’s first overlord. Under Prince Cozar’s long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.

Upon Cozar’s death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.

Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days. Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space just beyond the asteroid’s air envelope. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar’s younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.

Though his place on the throne is secure for now, Prince Andru is merely one player in a maze of political intrigue. He has a host of agents and forces loyal to him, but he must act with consideration, since he has opponents who would rather see Bral ruled by a more ineffectual leader or by a council that could more easily be influenced. Andru maintains his strong base of support because he is a serious and intelligent person—often likened to his grandfather, Prince Cozar, in this regard—and he isn’t easily intimidated.

> [!question] Note: Where Is the Rock?
> The Rock of Bral can move through Wildspace using it's vanes, but for the last few decades it has primarily positioned itself in the Tears of Selûne, a cluster of asteroids that trail beside the moon Selûne which orbits the planet Toril. This means that the Rock of Bral is effectively a satellite of Toril, which some of you may know as the primary setting in the Forgotten Realms and setting for Baldur's Gate 3. This places the Rock within the Realmspace Crystal Sphere.

###### Life on the Rock
Bral is populated by an outlandish collection of traders, rogues, mercenaries, pirates, nobles, and entrepreneurs. Generally, law enforcement is sporadic, which means that order is an elusive concept. Most folks who call the Rock home adhere to two principles: mind your own business whenever possible, and enough gold can fix anything.

##### Districts
- ###### High City
	Rising above the rest of Bral on the trailing edge of the asteroid, the High City is a green, spacious expanse that holds Prince Andru’s palace, called Starhaven, and various noble estates.

---
- ###### Middle City
	The financial and mercantile center of Bral, the Middle City is home to thousands of Bralians who can afford to live outside the Low City but don’t have the privilege or means to dwell behind the walls of the High City.

---
- ###### Low City
	The beating heart of the Rock lies in the warren of streets and crowded markets of the Low City. It buzzes with activity at all hours, its streets choked with boisterous peddlers, clamorous beggars, and sneaky thieves. The Low City has a preponderance of taverns, inns, alehouses, shops, and crafting establishments and an equally staggering number of vacant buildings. It is also home to the docks of the city,  a place that never sleeps.

---
- ###### Underside
	The underside of the Rock is under the purview of the prince. No private citizens are allowed to reside here. The surface area is devoted mostly to fields that are planted and cultivated to replenish Bral’s supplies of food and air. It also contains the headquarters and docks of the royal navy, barracks that house prisoners, and the army headquarters known as the Citadel, which overlooks the entire expanse. The underside is under military control. Unauthorized visitors who get themselves apprehended are generally assumed to be either spies or prisoners trying to escape. 

### Character Creation Guidelines
We will be using the **2024 Ruleset** for character creation and I highly encourage you to choose options from the new rules, although it is not required.  I do not adhere strictly to the rules 100% of the time. As a dungeon master it is my job to create a fun, dramatic, and tense story driven game. Sometimes the rules can actually get in the way of this, and I believe I have proved to all of you that I have your best interests in mind, so when I change things or adjust things, please be patient and understand that Dungeons & Dragons is far from a perfect system. 

> [!question] Note: The 70/30 Law
> Since Spelljammer is such a unique setting, it might be hard to imagine it's particular blend of fantasy science fiction. It may help to use the 70/30 law. While designing for Treasure Planet, the crew operated on a rule they called the "70/30 Law" (an idea that art director Andy Gaskill has credited to Ron Clements), which meant that the overall look of the film's artwork should be 70% traditional and 30% sci-fi.

#### Species
Nearly any of the many species in the many worlds of DnD make sense within a Spelljammer adventure, but don't sleep on the classic fantasy species from the standard Player's Handbook. With that said, there are a number of species semi native to wildspace and beyond that are common throughout Spelljammer. I highly encourage you to consider these fantastical species as they anchor you in the world and make for a composition of characters wholly unique to Spelljammer. I will also list a few species not directly from Spelljammer but that fit within the setting quite well. You can see their traits by viewing them during character creation on DnD Beyond. What I won't be allowing is content form third party sources (partnered content).

> [!question] Note: Monstrous Species
> Spelljammer offers the opportunity to play as one of the many monstrous species from the worlds of DnD. In space, many of the prejudices present in more classical fantasy settings don't hold as firm, but know that doesn't mean they are completely absent.

##### Astral Elf
Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf’s eyes.

Because nothing ages on the Astral Plane, astral elves who inhabit that plane can be very old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on the passage of time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral elves who don’t dwell on the Astral Plane can live to be more than 750 years old.

##### Autognome
Autognomes are mechanical beings built by rock gnomes. Sometimes, because of a malfunction or a unique circumstance, an autognome becomes separated from its creator and strikes out on its own.

An autognome bears a resemblance to its creator, and most autognomes are programmed to speak and understand Gnomish. The internal components used in an autognome’s manufacture can vary wildly; one autognome might have an actual beating heart in its chest cavity, while another might be powered by stardust or intricate clockwork gears.

Like gnomes, autognomes can live for centuries, typically up to 500 years.

##### Giff
Giff are tall, broad-shouldered folk with hippo-like features. Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, giff are noticed wherever they go. Giff put their great size to use in all sorts of ways, from lifting heavy loads and tying tight knots to opening stuck doors and seeing over crowds. They’re also natural swimmers.

Most giff believe they originated on one world, but their home world is now the stuff of legend, because no living giff has seen it or knows where it is. The divine beings who created giff have likewise been forgotten. Their titanic petrified bodies drift on the Astral Sea, isolated and unrecognizable in their current forms.

Although they don’t realize it, giff are drawn to the Astral Plane because, on a deep psychic level, they remain connected to their creator gods, who have just enough divine spark left in them to imbue giff with sparks of their own, which giff have learned to channel through their weapons. Most giff have no idea where this so-called astral spark comes from, but they feel its presence most strongly when they are in Wildspace or the Astral Sea.

Giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and head-butting contests, but they rarely escalate beyond that.

##### Hadozee
Hadozees’ progenitors were mammals no bigger than house cats. Hunted by larger natural predators, they took to the trees and evolved wing-like flaps that enabled them to glide from branch to branch.

Today, hadozees are sapient, bipedal beings eager to leave behind the fearsome predators of their home world and explore other worlds.

In addition to being natural climbers, hadozees have feet that are as dexterous as their hands, even to the extent of having opposable thumbs. Membranes of skin hang loosely from their arms and legs. When stretched taut, these membranes enable hadozees to glide. Hadozees wrap these wings around themselves to keep warm.

##### Plasmoid
Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there’s little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.

Plasmoids don’t have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.

When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.

##### Thri-kreen
Thri-kreen have insectile features and two pairs of arms. Their bodies are encased in protective chitin. They can alter the coloration of this carapace to blend in with their natural surroundings.

Although thri-kreen don’t sleep, they do require periods of inactivity to revitalize themselves. During these periods, they are fully aware of what’s happening around them.

Thri-kreen speak by clacking their mandibles and waving their antennae, indicating to other thri-kreen what they are thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this method of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. To interact with other folk, thri-kreen rely on a form of telepathy.

##### Gith
The story of the gith is rooted in a cruel twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers (illithids) that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.

The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu’narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.

The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki’s racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.

If the two races were ever to team up against the illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip the balance in their favor. But as long as the githyanki and githzerai stay at each other’s throats, their goal of ultimate victory over their original common enemy will likely remain unachieved.

> [!question] Note: Gith Lore
> The Gith have quite a lot of lore that establishes their conflict with both each other and the mind flayers. What you see now is a cursory glace. Should you be interested in this lore, a whole chapter of Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is dedicated to them. It also has a number of tables that can assist in making a gith character. I can copy it into these notes for easier access if necessary.

###### Githyanki
Since winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become corrupt raiders and destroyers under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith. They dwell on the Astral Plane in the city of Tu’narath, a metropolis built on and in the corpse of a deity. Vlaakith commands the loyalty of the githyanki from her personal stronghold, Susurrus, also called the Palace of Whispers, which is located deep inside the floating city. Vlaakith sits at the center of everything concerning the githyanki. She is their ruler in every sphere of activity and, as such, demands and receives utter obedience.

From birth, githyanki are conditioned to fight and die for their queen. Children endure a brutal upbringing that constantly preaches devotion to Vlaakith. Each of the fortified settlements where young githyanki are raised and trained is a combination of military academy and cult headquarters.

During the great war between the mind flayers and the gith, one of the githyanki’s greatest achievements was their discovery of the magic that mind flayers used to produce and propel the flying vessels that the illithids used to travel between worlds. Indeed, Spelljammers.

Now, the githyanki scour the worlds of the Material Plane in their versions of those craft. Their astral ships are ideal for carrying troops and the spoils of their raids. Their wizards’ divination magic seeks out great treasures. Under the guidance of Vlaakith, the supreme leaders organize raiding parties and dispatch them to return with the spoils of war.

###### Githzerai
The githzerai were born as a race at the end of the gith’s bloody, genocidal uprising against the mind flayers. A gith named Zerthimon, who had gained a significant following during the conflict, challenged Gith’s plans and her leadership. Gith was evil, the newcomer proclaimed, and she would lead the people into darkness and tyranny not unlike the one imposed by the illithids.

Thus, no sooner had the gith defeated their sworn enemies than they were plunged into a bitter civil war. In the ensuing conflict, Zerthimon was killed and his followers, naming themselves githzerai, relocated their civilization to the plane of Limbo.

Today, under the leadership of the Great Githzerai, Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith, the githzerai continue to stand fast against the githyanki, as well as taking their revenge on the mind flayers. Through forays into the Material Plane and other realms, they provide stiff opposition to their enemies’ plans for world domination.

---
***<p style="text-align:center;">"Under the illithids, we and the githyanki fought and died across a thousand worlds for implacable masters. Under Vlaakith, our kin fight and die across a thousand words for an implacable master. And they call that liberation?" — Adaka Fell Hand, githzerai monk</p>***![Githzerai.png](/img/user/Z_Art/Githzerai.png)**<p style="text-align:center;">Githzerai Monks</p>**

Strong-minded philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Their society focuses on enhancing the potential of the mind through meditation, education, and physical tests. The most accomplished among them stand as exemplars of the githzerai’s monastic principles, but even those who perform mundane duties in a community have a significant measure of the same mental fortitude.

Living in the ever-turbulent churn of Limbo requires all githzerai to harness the power of thought to counteract and hold at bay the chaos-stuff of the plane. If they were not relentless in this effort, the tides of Limbo would overwhelm and destroy them.

The githzerai have a unity of purpose that comes from their reverence for their great heroes and their desire to emulate the virtues of those figures in their everyday lives.

#### Class
I will keep and updated list of what classes each of you has chosen below. When you alert me as to your class, I will consider that locked in. Each of you must play a different class. Should you change your mind or have conflicts regarding who gets to play what, please work that out with each other. Yes, Eli you can play paladin if no one else wishes to. Also remember that Artificer fits particularly well within the world of Spelljammer. Know that if you do play that class you will be playing the 2014 version, I'm not coughing over upwards of $30 on a single class.

Remember that this adventure begins at level 4, so consider what achievements your character already has within the archetype of their class and how that might affect their story. You character will also begin the game with 1 uncommon magic item of you choice that I allow. Consider tying this item into their story or journey in some way. Perhaps it was a gift from a family member or adventuring patron, or a souvenir form their first adventure?  Please look in the Dungeon Masters Guide to find such items.

##### Recommendations
This is it my friends, the last section, I promise. Below you will find three recommendations I have for subclasses that fit particularly well with Spelljammer as a setting. 

###### Path of the World Tree Barbarian
Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their Rage. This tree grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them to each other and the Material Plane. These Barbarians draw on the tree’s magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.

###### Circle of the Stars Druid
The Circle of the Stars has tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By understanding these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos.

###### Aberrant Sorcery
An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.
